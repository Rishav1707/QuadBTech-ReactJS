# QuadBTech - ReactJS Internship Task

Created a 2 screen React JS application using this API: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all . A basic UI to display the show names and a few details about it. Included a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show.
